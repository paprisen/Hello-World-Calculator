Aim: To print Hello World and design a Claculator to add,subtract,multiply and divide two user input number.

Apparatus: Online compiler C++ 

Theory: The program begins with #include , allowing the program to use cin and cout for input/output.  It starts by including the iostream library, which allows the use of cin and cout for input and output. Inside the main() function, it first prints a welcome message like “Hello World” to the screen using cout. 

About Calculator: Our calculator prompts the user for two float numbers. We declared five float variables (two for user input and three for the result of the arithmetic operations). The variables we created are; a, b for user input and sum, sub, mul, and div for storing the result of our arithmetic commands. The calculator does the following calculations: sum = a + b; sub = a - b; mul = a * b; div = a / b;

The program then prints each of the calculations in the format of "Sum:" followed by std::endl to print the result of the calculation on a new line. We conclude with return 0; which indicates successful execution of our program.

Conclusion: This Program will help in understaing of basic input and output, diffrent arithmetic operation in C++.
