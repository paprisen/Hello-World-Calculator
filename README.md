Aim: To print Hello World and design a Claculator to add,subtract,multiply and divide two user input number.

Apparatus: Programiz online compiler or VS Code

Theory:-This C++ program brings together two basic concepts to help beginners get started: displaying output and performing simple calculations. It starts by including the iostream library, which allows the use of cin and cout for input and output. Inside the main() function, it first prints a welcome message like “Hello World” to the screen using cout. Then, it moves on to a calculator section, where it asks the user to enter two floating-point numbers. These numbers are stored in variables and used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each result is displayed on the screen, and because the program uses the float data type, it handles decimal values accurately. The program finishes with return 0; to indicate successful execution. Altogether, this example demonstrates the basics of C++ syntax, input/output handling, and arithmetic operations in a clear and beginner-friendly way.

Conclusion:-We are able to understand the basic of C++ with its syntax(Hello World) & able to create a basic calculator.
