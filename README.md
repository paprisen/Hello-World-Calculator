Aim: To print Hello World and design a Claculator to add,subtract,multiply and divide two user input number.

Apparatus: Online compiler C++ 

Theory: The program begins with #include , allowing the program to use cin and cout for input/output.  It starts by including the iostream library, which allows the use of cin and cout for input and output. Inside the main() function, it first prints a welcome message like “Hello World” to the screen using cout. 

About Calculator: These numbers are stored in variables and used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each result is displayed on the screen, and because the program uses the float data type, it handles decimal values accurately. The program finishes with return 0; to indicate successful execution.

Conclusion: This Program will help in understaing of basic input and output, diffrent arithmetic operation in C++.
